                    <h2>COST OF NOT MANAGING</h2>
                    <p>It is a good idea to get an understanding of the various personality types that work for you. This is not so much
                        as to “label” someone, but it should be a means to recognize some of the coaching opportunities you are
                        presented on a daily basis.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Coercive Leader</h4>
                    <img src="{{ asset('assets/img/cost/1.png') }} ">
                    <p>Most often Coercive leaders do not think of themselves as intimidating. They perceive their behavior as direct
                        and straightforward rather than threatening. Unfortunately, this style often frightens other people who will go
                        to great lengths to avoid this person. They are highly controlling, often attacking, freely uses threats and
                        punishments.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Coaching Opportunity:</h4>
                    <p>Just by utilizing the coaching leadership style, you will be modeling an alternative leadership style for this
                        employee. In cases where this doesn’t rub off on the employee, a more direct approach should be used. You may
                        try treating this like you would when addressing poor personal habits. See Key 4. COACHING FOR ADDRESSING POOR
                        PERSONAL HABITS.</p>
                    <h4>Stress Junkie</h4>
                    <img src="{{ asset('assets/img/cost/2.png') }} ">
                    <p>If the Stress Junkie is not really stressed, he/she is a carrier. The Stress Junkie causes a whirlwind of
                        unneeded activity and stress for others… e.g. “this needs to be done now, wait it just changed… now I need it
                        done in French last Friday.” The funny thing is, a lot of work does not get done when this person is around.
                        They unknowingly train others not to act because they know it’s just going to change.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Coaching Opportunity:</h4>
                    <p>With the Stress Junkie, you have to determine if their stress and anxiety is due to a lack of structure and
                        organization or a psychological need to be perceived as being busy or the last minute savior in a crisis. No
                        matter what the reason, you have a coaching opportunity to improve their time management skills and define
                        expectations for them that includes finishing assigned work on time and not just looking busy. See Key 2.

                    <h4>Control Freak</h4>
                    <img src="{{ asset('assets/img/cost/3.png') }} ">
                    <p>A.K.A. the bottleneck of the organization. Information must go through this person before toilet paper can be
                        changed in the bathroom. When a Control Freak micromanages every thought, decision and action, they teach others
                        not to think or act for themselves.</p>
                    <h4>Coaching Opportunity:</h4>
                    <p>This person has an internal need to be needed, so they create situations that require their approval. This is not
                        only demotivating to employees; it is inefficient and ineffective in accomplishing work. Share with them the
                        things you learned in this material about motivating and demotivating people. Talk about empowering employees
                        and the importance of delegating and helping them solve problems on their own. Emphasize that the organization
                        values teamwork and independent thinking and he/she will be evaluated on how well his/her employees work
                        independently, not how many decisions they make. See Key 8. KNOWING WHAT “GOOD” LOOKS LIKE

                    <h4>Door Mat</h4>
                    <img src="{{ asset('assets/img/cost/4.png') }} ">
                    <p>The door mat is the visible half of a passive/aggressive style. This style is nice and accepting to your face,
                        but when you are not around there is trouble. The Door Mat will downgrade your position and attempt to dissolve
                        loyalty among team members. In addition, he/she will withhold important information when they lose their status
                        of being the authority on the subject.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Coaching Opportunity:</h4>
                    <p>In this situation, the coach needs to expose the aggressive agitator behind the seemingly passive door mat. Once
                        exposed, the coach can work with the employee to find ways to build their self- esteem other than by tearing
                        down others to build themselves up. The message is they can build themselves up by building the team up, not
                        tearing it down. See Key 6. COACHING FOR CONTRACTING FOR CONSEQUENCES
                    </p>
                    <h4>Instant Expert</h4>
                    <img src="{{ asset('assets/img/cost/5.png') }} ">
                    <p>The Instant Expert! The one and only person who knows how to turn up or down the heat in the building. This
                        person may be the Ph.D., or computer guru. Or they simply are the person everyone turns to. The Instant Expert
                        is uneasy teaching others how to do things because then they lose their status of being the authority on the
                        subject.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Coaching Opportunity:</h4>
                    <p>The coach needs to draw the curtain back on this employee, also. First, they need to protect others from the
                        Answer Man’s attempt to make others feel inferior so they won’t challenge him/her. They must also challenge this
                        instant expert to back up their facts with data. Too often, after they have intimidated others into silence,
                        they are free to be loose with their facts. Finally, the coach needs to counsel this employee on the negative
                        impact this behavior has on others. Then give them replacement behaviors that allows for others on the team to
                        share their point of view without feeling inferior. In the final analysis, the Instant Expert will have many
                        conflicts with other employees that will require resolution. See Key 5. COACHING CONFLICT RESOLUTION</p>
                    <h4>Artful Dodger</h4>
                    <img src="{{ asset('assets/img/cost/6.png') }} ">
                    <p>Always the shadow, never the face. You can never place a finger on exactly what this person is doing all day, nor
                        can you find him/her to discuss your concerns. They always have a plausible excuse for not having their work
                        done and it’s never their fault. You know you’re dealing with an artful dodger when you feel confused in their
                        presence but on the drive home, you suddenly say “Hey, wait a minute!”
                    </p>
                    <h4>Coaching Opportunity:</h4>
                    <p>The coach must clearly define specific expectations of this employee with deadlines and accountability and
                        consequences for not meeting them. They must shine a spotlight on this shadowy figure. See Key 2. COACHING FOR
                        IMPROVING POOR PERFORMANCE
                    </p>
                    <h4>Malevolent Clown</h4>
                    <img src="{{ asset('assets/img/cost/7.png') }} ">
                    <p>They use humor as an excuse to make painful comments directed to others. Their comments and teasing can be
                        relentless. They will often say… “I was just kidding”. Sometimes, other employees will laugh at their jokes
                        without knowing how hurtful they are to others around them. </p>
                    <h4>Coaching Opportunity:</h4>
                    <p>The first priority of the coach is to protect other team members from comments meant to hurt or make fun, by the
                        Malevolent Clown. Make no mistake about it, this employee is a bully and must be treated as such. They need to
                        understand their behavior is unacceptable and has no place in your work environment. Then coach this employee
                        with replacement behaviors and the proper use of humor. See Key 6. COACHING FOR CONTRACTING FOR CONSEQUENCES</p>
                    <p>It is suggested you spend some time to determine how many each of these personality types are within your sphere
                        of influence. Once recognized, you can apply many of the tools, concepts, and module learnings to lessen any
                        negative impact they may have on the organization.

                    <p>The following is an example of how the costs of not coaching these personalities within the organization can be
                        calculated to bring insights into the importance of managing employees more efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Cost of Not Managing Better)
                        Manager and HR Director each earns around $60,000 ($30/Hr.). The manager has 10 employees earning around $40,000
                        ($25/Hr.)/per.
                        About once a week at one of the 8 meetings the manager leads, the manager explodes and must do damage control
                        for the next few days in terms of communicating what was not done after the incident. This involves typically 6
                        team members.
                        Everyone is shaken, and no one is very productive for the next two hours.
                        In addition, the HR person spends time doing damage control when this happens.

                    <p>Because we all are responsible for the bottom line, to one degree or another, the costs of doing business are
                        important to each and every one of us. It’s easy to find out the cost of wages, machines, tools, supplies and
                        services so our attention can become fixed on those tangible items. However, when it come to the performance of
                        people the costs are not so obvious. Management Matters makes a commitment to help you identify these costs in
                        all our Modules, when appropriate. </p>
